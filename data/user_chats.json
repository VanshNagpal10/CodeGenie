Usually, the 2 Sum problem gives you:\n- An array (or list) of numbers\n- A target number\n\nYour goal is to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target, right?\n\nWhat do you think would be a simple way to check this? For example, how might you start checking pairs of numbers to see if they add up to the target?"

Do you have that as well?\n\nIf yes, how do you think you might check two numbers from the list to see if they add up to the target? For example, would you consider comparing every possible pair, or do you have another idea?"

Using a hash (like a dictionary or map) to store numbers as you go can help you find the complementary number efficiently.\n\nTo make sure I understand your plan:\n- You’ll iterate through the array once.\n- For each number, you’ll calculate the complement (which is target - current number).\n- Then you’ll check if this complement exists in your hash.\n- If it does, you’ve found your pair!\n\nDoes that sound right? \n\nWhat data structure do you plan to use for the hash, and how will you handle storing and checking the numbers?"

In C++, an `unordered_map` is a perfect choice for this.\n\nIt allows you to:\n- Insert numbers and their indices quickly.\n- Check if the complement exists in constant average time.\n\nNow, can you think about what you would store as the key and what as the value in the `unordered_map`? For example, would you store the number as the key and its index as the value, or the other way around?"

Does it calculate the middle between `low` and `high` correctly?\n\nHint: Remember operator precedence and how division and addition associate in C++.\n\nHow would you write the expression to avoid any surprises?"

A safer way is `low + (high - low) / 2`. Do you see why that helps?\n\nNow, once you have `mid`, what’s your plan for checking if the target is at `mid`, or if you need to search left or right? How would you update `low` and `high`?"
